#A/B Testing: Using a Calculator
#An A/B Test is a scientific method of choosing between two options (Option A and Option B)
#for an A/B test, a sample size calculator requires three numbers:
#Baseline conversion rate
#Minimum detectable effect
#Statistical significance

______________________

#A/B Testing: Understanding the Baseline
#Generally, our metric will be the percent of users who take a certain action after interacting with one of our options.
#Our initial estimate of our metric is called a baseline.
#We can usually calculate a baseline by looking at historical data for the option that we’re currently using.

#A/B Testing: Determining Lift
#we need to know the smallest difference that we actually care to measure. This “smallest difference” is called lift.
#Lift is generally expressed as a percent of the baseline conversion rate.

lift_eight_percent_to_twelve_percent = 100 * (12 - 8) / 8

ten_percent_up_fifty_percent = 10.0 + 5

#A/B Testing: Don't Interfere With Your Tests
#By arbitrarily extending the study until it reaches significance, we fool ourselves!

#Sample Size Calculator for Margin of Error
#Margin of Error
#What does it mean to have “enough” people for a survey?
#Population Size
#So, for experiments like this, we use the highest population size we can. 
#Normally, 100,000 will suffice, as changes become negligible beyond that.
#Likely Sample Proportion
#This guess could be based upon the results from a previous survey, or perhaps the results of a small pilot study before the real study.
#If we do not have historical data, we normally use 50%, which gives the most conservative (i.e., largest required) sample size.

#Confidence Level
#We normally use a confidence level of 95%.

#Sample Size of a Survey
import math

margin_of_error = 4
confidence_level = 95
likely_proportion = 40
population_size = 100000

sample_size = 573

#sample_size/120, rounded up:
#weeks_of_survey = 5
weeks_of_survey = math.ceil(sample_size/120.0)
print weeks_of_survey

#Differing Survey Results
# Baseline conversion rate: 35%
# Statistical significance: 85%
# Minimum detectable effect: 40%
