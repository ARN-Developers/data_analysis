#Independent Events
#If two events are independent, then the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event.
#If two events are dependent, then when one event occurs, the probability of the other event occurring changes in a predictable way.

____________

#Conditional Probability
#Conditional probability is the probability that two events happen.
#It's easiest to calculate conditional probability when the two events are independent.
#the probability of an event is written as P(event)
#If two events are independent then: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
import numpy as np
gym = 3. / 5
#The period after the 3 is necessary for the float
print gym
p_rain_and_gym = 0.3 * gym
print p_rain_and_gym

#Testing for a Rare Disease
import numpy as np
p_disease_and_correct = (1. / 100000) * 0.99
p_no_disease_and_incorrect = ((1-(1. / 100000)) * 0.01)

#Bayes Theorem
#That extra information about how we expect the world to work is called a prior.
#When we only use the first piece of information (the result of the test), it's called a Frequentist Approach to statistics
#When we incorporate our prior, it's called a Bayesian Approach.

p_disease_given_positive = (p_positive_given_disease * p_disease) / p_positive

#Review
#In this course, we learned several new definitions:

  Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the second event
  If two events are independent then, 
  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
  A prior is an additional piece of information that tells us how likely an event is
  A frequentist approach to statistics does not incorporate a prior
  A Bayesian approach to statistics incorporates prior knowledge
  Bayes' Theorem is
